// If/else syntax debug
// While making a game, your partner, Greg, decided to create a function to check if the user is still alive called checkAlive/CheckAlive/check_alive. Unfortunately, Greg made some errors while creating the function.



function checkAlive (health) {
  if (health <= 0) {
    return false
  } else {

    return true
  }
}
